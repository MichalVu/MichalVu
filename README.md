- 👋 Hi, my name is Michal.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, algorithms and desktop applications.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make solid desktop applications, in order to semiautomatize my LEGO Business, using C# and C++. I am also learning how to work
- with API's and SQL databases.
- 
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on anything that will improve my skills - especially in the domain of C#/C++ or API's.
- 
- 📫 For now, you can reach me here..
